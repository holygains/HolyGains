🛡️ Holy Gains License - Thou Shalt Not Rug
By the divine decree of the blockchain gods (and maybe a meme or two), this project is licensed under the Holy Gains License — a sacred covenant between code and community.

Thou shalt HODL responsibly.
Thou shalt not rug thy neighbor.
Thou may forketh freely — but remember, Holy Gains blesses only the righteous builders, not the copy-paste degenerates.
If thou maketh profits, give thanks to Holy Gains, and maybe buy a Lambo.
Disclaimer: This license does not guarantee moon landings, Lambos, or eternal green candles — but it definitely protects against false prophets and rug pulls.
